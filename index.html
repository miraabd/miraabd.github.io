<h2> <hr> Demography <h2>
<p>Kokshetau is the eighteenth-largest city in Kazakhstan. Kokshetau is an ethnically and culturally diverse city. Kokshetau ranks fourth in terms of population in Northern Kazakhstan, ranking after Pavlodar, Kostanay and Petropavl. It has changed its demographics, nowadays having more ethnic Kazakhs in a city that formerly had a Slavic majority. It is the only regional center in Northern Kazakhstan where Kazakhs make up the majority. Despite Kokshetau's Kazakh majority, Russian is the dominant language in the city. It is also common to find the Kazakh being spoken in the city, mainly by Kazakhs and other Turkic people. Residents of Kokshetau are referred to as "көкшетаулықтар" (kökşetaulyqtar) in Kazakh and "кокшета́уцы" (kokshetautsy) in Russian.<p>
